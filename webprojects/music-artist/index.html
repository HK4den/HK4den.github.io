                <img src="images/PsychoWarrior.jpg" alt="PsychoWarrior: MG ULTRA X album art">
                <p>PsychoWarrior is the newest release of machine girl's, and to say its one of their craziest releases
                    would be an understatement. Filled with crazy quick elecronics and drums, and deep hard sounding
                    bass and guitar, this album has been struck as a new favorite for many fans.</p>
                <p>Released: October 24th, 2025</p>

                <h3>MG ULTRA</h3>
                <img src="images/MgUltra.jpg" alt="MG ULTRA album art">
                <p>Released after 4 years without a normal lyrical album, MG Ultra struck fans hard with its songs about
                    conspiricism and the mind itself. It drives its knife in deep with its hardcore sound and keeps you
                    wanting more with its dystopian cyberpunk feel</p>
                <p>Released: October 18th, 2024</p>
